* i say this is an evaluation of the PassGAN system, yet i have made no attempt to reproduce their results
* With the NL thing not panning out, i have to fall back on "use of passgan with italian passwords" as the main contribution of the thesis: this is hard to argue because i did not try to crack test_10c with thir pre-trained model in order to see if PassGAN performed better
* I mis-understood the way they did their tests, they were probably just using PassGAN. we tridd running PassGAN with 50 mil and 100mil results and it barely made a diffference.
* I still dont really know what to conclude because of the points above. also not sure what the practical application of this might be.

I think all these things should at least be acknowledged in the thesis, maybe i can ever try them after the hand in and bring my results at the exam as a way to make up for it.
I dont really have the time to do them now, thhe best i could do is to do 1 try of the second point and giv it an offhand mention.
