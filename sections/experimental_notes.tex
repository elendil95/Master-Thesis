\section{Experimental notes}
When training PassGAN on the libero set, the samples generates seem to have the genral pattern of user passwords; the network tries to generate strings that look like italian words, but are not. Testing of the output has not been performed yet, but i do wonder if including natural language dictionarie can help the network generate grammatically correct words and phrases.

It is yet to be established how grammatically correct words may affet the cracking.

In the next test i will try and add NL dictionaries and see how it goes. 

My hope is that the network can retain the currect password characteristics, but imporve its ability to generate natural langage fragments. Perhaps trnaference learning might come in handy for this?
